Scraping Page Rank Script

===================

Results will be output to `results/`. The directory will be create dynamically by fileutils once the script runs.

Currently just running this for Rome - which is hardcoded in.


===================

### Usage:

```
require_relative 'scraper'

Comparer.new.compare
```
