Scraping Page Rank Script

===================

A work in progress as of August 2016.

For both components you will require an input file, which must be loaded into `properties/`.

Results will be output to `results/`. The directory will be create dynamically by fileutils once the script runs.


===================

### Usage:

```
require_relative 'scraper'

Comparer.new.compare
```

```
Report.generate
```
